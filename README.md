Design of a prototype of an EMG device for the detection of Bruxism

The work presents the design of a prototype of an EMG device for the detection of Bruxism capable of sending data in real time to the IoT platform of LISHA department at
UFSC. The work presents the functioning of the hardware front end for the signal acquisition, the signal filtered, rectified and integrated and the program for transmitting
the information in real time. For the signal processing was used an arduino mega and a Raspberry for sending the data over the internet.
